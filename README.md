This project is about Automating Whatsapp messages with Python using library pywhatkit.
Here I have written the code in two ways which works the same.

Steps to follow:
1. Install Python and pyCharm IDE
2. Setup the environmental path of Python after installation
3. Create new project, then open terminal and install pywhatkit using command -> pip install pywhatkit
4. once pip is installed follow the code to *send whatsapp message to a contact* added in repository
5. Result: The test message is sent to the contact
